### Focus Area
I prioritized **architecture**, implementing **MVVM + Clean Architecture** to ensure scalability, testability, and maintainability. This approach provides a clear separation of concerns, improves state management, and keeps the codebase modular and reusable.

### Time Spent
4-5 hours

### Trade-offs
I prioritized **clean design and maintainability** over rapid development. This resulted in a more structured codebase but required extra setup. Some minor optimizations were deferred to keep the design clear and modular.

### Weakest Part
Since the app consists of only one screen, I didnâ€™t implement any navigation logic. If the app were to scale, a proper navigation flow would need to be added.
